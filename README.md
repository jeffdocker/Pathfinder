# Pathfinder
Pathfinding program that generates terrain maps and uses A* to visualize the shortest path.
The program generates 50 terrain maps that are color and symbol coded to distinguish terrain types.
The program allows for user input of goal and start coordinates or random.
There are multiple heuristics for the distance that change the heuristic function for the A* search.
